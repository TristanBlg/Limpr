# Limpr
Limpr is a React-Redux interface, it allows you to listen some music.
<br>
That's a **first step into React-Redux environment** for me.

## Quick start
### Development
You have to run 2 servers to develop :

1. Node server<br>
`npm run server`

2. Dev server<br>
`npm start`

### Build
It's not recommended to use Limpr in production.

> Don't forget to change the API's URL used in `/src/actions/index.js`
>
> `npm run build`
